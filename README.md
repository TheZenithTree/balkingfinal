This was my final project for COMS 3313 (Software Engineering) at Arkansas Tech University during Spring 2024.

In this project, we were tasked with researching a design pattern that we had not gone over in class and creating a presentation on it.
This included a working code example. 
Within this repository, the working code examples I made are attached as well as the powerpoint presentation.
